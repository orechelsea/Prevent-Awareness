                        going to the pub and worked as an electrician. At 19, Thomas became interested in Islam and
                        began to change. He started using his own pans for cooking and became angry when his family
                        watched TV or listened to music. Thomas changed his name and appearance and lost his
                        apprenticeship due to expressing extremist views at work. He traveled abroad, claiming he was
                        going to study Arabic, but later called to say he had joined a terrorist group. Shortly after,
                        Thomas was killed, leaving his mother and brother devastated. The video above is the
